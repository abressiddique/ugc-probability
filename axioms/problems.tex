\item P and Q are considering to apply for a job. The probability that P applies for the job is $\dfrac{1}{4}$, the probability that P applies for the job given that Q applies for the job is $\dfrac{1}{2}$, and the probability that Q applies for the job given that P applies for the job is $\dfrac{1}{3}$. Then the probability that P does not apply for the job given that Q does not apply for the job is
